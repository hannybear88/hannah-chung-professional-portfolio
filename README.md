# Professional-Portfolio: Homework Challenge #2


## Project Description
This application directs the user to an existing site called Horiseon. I was hired by a marketing agency to refacture the code for this site and make it so that it is more accessible. I refactured the code to not only because this is an assignment, but also practice my hacking skills and coding skills, so that I can improve on it. I refractured the website by editing the HTML and CSS Files. I did this to help the webistei by taking out any unncessary div elements, added comments to make it more clear on what changes I had made, and made sure there not any identical CSS classes.  Some challenges I had faced was to see what needed to be refactured and deleted without actually changing what the site can do.
